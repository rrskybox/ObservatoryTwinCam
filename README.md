This camera monitor uses RtspClientSharp and FFmpeg to view two security cameras using RTSP protocol.  The app is designed for use when remotely operating a simple astronomical observatory.  That is, upon launch, the monitor automatically brings up the two cameras and turns on light.  Upon close, light is automatically turned off.  Manual controls for lights and PTZ (no Z) are included.  The assumption being that the user just wants a quick visual check of the system without the hassle of manually turning lighting on and wants to avoid accidentally leaving it on during imaging.  The app has been tested only with Amcrest security cameras.
